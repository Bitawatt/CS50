Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The only erroneous probabilities existed in the '10 Simulations' run
- where, given the way the probabilities are generated, it was not enough to make viable predictions.
Where, `N` >= 100, the probabilities represented a calculable margin of error.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

There was no effective change after 10e4-simulations, and no substantial change (< 0.9) after 10e3-simulations.
Depending on how much one had bet on the tournament versus the cost of the computation time, one of these two
levels would have been sufficient.
