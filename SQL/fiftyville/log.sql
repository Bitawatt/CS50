-- Keep a log of any SQL queries you execute as you solve the mystery.

/*
Goal:

    1. Discover who the theif is
    2. What city the thief escaped to, and
    3. Who the thief's accomplice is who helped them escape

Specs:

    - Keep a log of all (valid) queries run on the database
        - comment each query
            - describing why the query is run
            - what information is desired from running each query

Hints:

    - The crime took place:
        - July 28, 2021
        - on Humphrey Street
        - in Fiftyville (USA)
    - executing `.tables` will list all of the tables in the database.
    - executing `.schema TABLE_NAME`, will show the `CREATE_TABLE` command
        used to create the table.
    - check out the `crime_scene_reports` table first, for a report that
        mathches the date and location of the crime.

        Comments:
            Due to the relevant information from the crime_scene_report, we fortunately have
                documentation of the comings and goings at the bakery, and a possible plate #.

        Information:
            license_plate:
                - 5P2BI95

        Next: Let's check out those interviews, and then maybe atms between the bakery
                and the airport.

| 6 |         |      |       |     | bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.                 |

| 1 | Raymond | 2021 | 7     | 28  | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.                |
| 6 |         |      |       |     | In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. |
| 3 |         |      |       |     | The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.                       |
+---+---------+------+-------+-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

        Comments: This was the logical first step
            From the above interviews we should be able to:
                - query who:
                    - `exit`ed the bakery between 10:15 am, and 10:25 am.
                    - made an atm_transactions, withdraw, on 'Leggett Street' on July 28, 2021
                        - from there get the `bank_account.person_id` from the `atm.account_number`
                    - made a `phone_calls` the between 10:15 am, and 10:25 am, on July 28, 2021. (`phone_calls.duration` is ambiguous)
                    - was on a flight out of town the next morning (purportedly the earliest)

        Information: (lots)
            - theif left bakery between:
                - 10:15 and 10:25
            - theif visited:
                - atm on Leggett Street
                - made a withdrawal
            - theif called someone:
                - < 1-minute
                - earliest flight
                    - Fiftyville departure
                    - July 29, 2021
                    - someone (not the theif, the accomplice) purchased a ticket

        Next:
            - re-query for license plates exiting the bakery
                - relate table.people with license plates
            - use the above query to cross:
                - passengers on flight
                - phone calls
            - query the atm
            - query the flight
                - purchase info (none)

                Result: NULL

                Information: No one that exited the bakery and was on the flight made the reported atm withdrawal.

                Next: Who was on the flight that also gave a crime_scene_reports interview - NULL
                        *well, I don't know...*
                    From Above:
                        From the interviews we should be able to query who:
                            - `exit`ed the bakery between 10:15 am, and 10:25 am.
                            - made an atm_transactions, withdraw, on 'Leggett Street' on July 28, 2021
                                - from there get the `bank_account.person_id` from the `atm.account_number`
                            - made a `phone_calls` the between 10:15 am, and 10:25 am, on July 28, 2021. (`phone_calls.duration` is ambiguous)
                            - was on a flight out of town the next morning (purportedly the earliest)
                    However:
                        - Luca:
                            - was on flight 36
                                - July 29,2021
                            - exited the bakery
                                - between 10:15 am and 10:25 am
                                - July 28,2021
                            - made an atm withdrawal
                                - at the Leggett Street location
                                - the morning of July 28, 2021
                            - did NOT make a phone call
                                - between 10:15 am and 10:25 am
                                - apparently on July 28, 2021 at all
                        - Sophia, Bruce, and Kelsey
                            - were on flight 36
                                - July 29,2021
                            - exited the bakery
                                - between 10:15 am and 10:25 am
                                - July 28,2021
                            - all made phone calls
                                - between 10:15 am and 10:25 am
                                - July 28,2021
                            - did NOT make any atm_transactions
                                - at the Leggett Street location
                                - the morning of July 28, 2021
                        Therefore:
                            - Since we have no persons who satisfy all of the witness interview claims:
                                - we must assume that at least one element of that information is in error.
                            - We discern that the greatest amount of uncertainty lies with the information regarding:
                                - "[the theif was] planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow."
                                    - "tomorrow" being July, 29 2021
                                    - perhaps this flight was book and they had to take the next to earliest flight (there's only two in the am)
                                        - query: finding people who exited the bakery that were on the second flight out of Fiftyville July 29, 2021

                Information:
                    - Kathryn and Luca both boarded flights from Fiftyville within:
                        - 15-hours of each other, and
                        - 23-hours of the theft of the rubber-duckie
                        - Those flights did not have the same destination - inconclusive

                Conclusion:
                    - Of the people leaving the scene of the crime
                        - Luca is the most likely culprit
                            - since they:
                                - made an atm withdrawal at the location, on the day, a witness saw the theif making a transaction
                                - boarded a flight (the earliest flight the following morning) as the theif was overheard to be planning
                                - made a phone call of the approximate duration as reported by a witness of the heinous crime
                    - Kathryn is the most likely accomplice:
                        - since they:
                            - are with whom the phone call was that was witnessed at the scene
                                - if Luca is the culprit
                            - also boarded a flight out of Fiftyville shortly after the atroscious crime

**************************************************************************************************************************************************
||| Thanks to `Check50` an innocent man does not stand accused tonight. It was a weak case, and I'm a bit ashamed of checking it having        |||
||| concluded that Luca and Kathryn where likely the guilty parties. Upon reflection an `=` was used where `IN` was necessary in a conditional |||
||| `WHERE` statement. This resulted in only querying the first available response instead of the intended list and an erroneous result where  |||
||| Bruce did not appear in the output to be suspected. Kathryn, Luca, please accept my humble apology - it was not you.                       |||
|||                                                                                                                                            |||
