GitHub Copilot: Sure! Here are a few other hash functions that you can experiment with:

1. Jenkins hash function: This hash function is designed to be fast and provide good distribution of hash values. It uses a mix of bitwise operations and multiplication to compute the hash value. Here is an example implementation:

```c
unsigned int jenkins_hash(const char *word, unsigned long N)
{
    unsigned int hash_value = 0;
    for (int i = 0, n = strlen(word); i < n; i++)
    {
        hash_value += word[i];
        hash_value += (hash_value << 10);
        hash_value ^= (hash_value >> 6);
    }
    hash_value += (hash_value << 3);
    hash_value ^= (hash_value >> 11);
    hash_value += (hash_value << 15);
    return hash_value % N;
}
```

2. MurmurHash: This hash function is designed to be fast and provide good distribution of hash values. It uses a mix of bitwise operations and multiplication to compute the hash value. Here is an example implementation:

```c
unsigned int murmur_hash(const char *word, unsigned long N)
{
    const unsigned int m = 0x5bd1e995;
    const int r = 24;
    unsigned int hash_value = strlen(word);
    const unsigned char *data = (const unsigned char *)word;
    while (strlen(word) >= 4)
    {
        unsigned int k = *(unsigned int *)data;
        k *= m;
        k ^= k >> r;
        k *= m;
        hash_value *= m;
        hash_value ^= k;
        data += 4;
        strlen(word) -= 4;
    }
    switch (strlen(word))
    {
        case 3:
            hash_value ^= data[2] << 16;
        case 2:
            hash_value ^= data[1] << 8;
        case 1:
            hash_value ^= data[0];
            hash_value *= m;
    }
    hash_value ^= hash_value >> 13;
    hash_value *= m;
    hash_value ^= hash_value >> 15;
    return hash_value % N;
}
```

3. FNV hash function: This hash function is designed to be fast and provide good distribution of hash values. It uses a mix of bitwise operations and multiplication to compute the hash value. Here is an example implementation:

```c
unsigned int fnv_hash(const char *word, unsigned long N)
{
    const unsigned int fnv_prime = 0x811c9dc5;
    unsigned int hash_value = 0;
    for (int i = 0, n = strlen(word); i < n; i++)
    {
        hash_value *= fnv_prime;
        hash_value ^= word[i];
    }
    return hash_value % N;
}
```

These are just a few examples of hash functions that you can experiment with. There are many other hash functions out there that you can try, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

----------------
## djb2 algorithm

GitHub Copilot: One way to optimize the hash function is to use a prime number for the size of the hash table. This can help to distribute the words evenly across the hash table and minimize collisions.

Another way to optimize the hash function is to use all of the characters in the word to compute the hash value, rather than just the first few characters. This helps to ensure that words with different characters are hashed to different buckets in the hash table.

Here is an example of a hash function that uses all of the characters in the word and a prime number for the size of the hash table:

```c
unsigned int hash(const char *word, unsigned long N)
{
    unsigned int hash_value = 0;
    for (int i = 0, n = strlen(word); i < n; i++)
    {
        hash_value = (hash_value << 2) ^ word[i];
    }
    return hash_value % N;
}
```

This hash function uses the djb2 algorithm, which is a widely-used hash function for strings. It multiplies the hash value by 33 and adds the ASCII value of each character in the word to compute the hash value. The hash value is then reduced to the range of the hash table using a modular arithmetic function.

To further optimize the hash function, you can experiment with different prime numbers for the size of the hash table and different algorithms for computing the hash value. You can also try to avoid patterns in the hash value that could cause words with similar characters to be hashed to the same bucket.

--------------------------------
GitHub Copilot: The Pearson hash function is a simple hash function that uses a lookup table to compute the hash value. Here's an example implementation of the Pearson hash function in C:

```c
// Pearson hash table
const unsigned char pearson_table[256] =
{
    98, 6, 85, 150, 36, 23, 112, 164, 135, 66, 57, 19, 33, 37, 221, 124,
    153, 186, 204, 215, 88, 130, 208, 206, 141, 31, 67, 70, 61, 82, 73, 109,
    65, 162, 116, 32, 207, 44, 81, 233, 77, 69, 250, 234, 176, 223, 245, 142,
    187, 140, 72, 18, 253, 186, 215, 94, 163, 146, 38, 68, 49, 197, 76, 202,
    146, 11, 204, 95, 50, 25, 63, 210, 91, 148, 13, 126, 143, 250, 255, 63,
    191, 194, 52, 90, 15, 83, 142, 39, 18, 7, 129, 118, 99, 119, 110, 35,
    228, 78, 252, 120, 189, 253, 221, 234, 17, 11, 89, 131, 92, 238, 27, 103,
    221, 6, 44, 249, 101, 246, 83, 230, 218, 155, 174, 56, 245, 157, 79, 200,
    97, 242, 29, 234, 28, 193, 222, 237, 152, 184, 224, 59, 98, 13, 233, 154,
    222, 201, 221, 214, 63, 225, 31, 152, 184, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
    // repeat the table to fill 256 bytes
};

// Hashes word to a number using the Pearson hash function
// - Input: word, with alphabetical characters and (possibly) apostrophes
// - Output: numerical index between 0 and N - 1, inclusive
// - Deterministic
unsigned int hash(const char *word)
{
    unsigned int hash_value = 0;
    for (int i = 0, n = strlen(word); i < n; i++)
    {
        hash_value = pearson_table[(hash_value ^ word[i]) % 256];
    }
    return hash_value % N;
}
```

In this implementation, the `pearson_table` is a lookup table that contains 256 bytes of data. The `hash` function uses this table to compute the hash value of the input word. The `^` operator is the bitwise XOR operator, which is used to combine the hash value with each character of the word. The `%` operator is used to ensure that the index into the `pearson_table` is always within the range of 0 to 255. Finally, the `%` operator is used again to ensure that the hash value is within the range of 0 to `N - 1`, where `N` is the number of buckets in the hash table.
